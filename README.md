# Face Mask Detection System

Well, I'm always enthusiastic & energetic when it comes to artificial intelligence! This project is an expo of the skills I've gained. I have gained internet references, I didn't count exactly how many, but yes I did refer to a lot of projects. Because, machine learning has never been something that I'd understand completely in the first go! Haha, gigs later...
* My project plan is basically:
    - Learn to implement ML & DL concepts by putting them into practice.
    - Build a base model that will run on any laptop using an IDE that can run python scripts/jupyter notebooks.
    - Once the base model is built, I'd make good use of my time to explore my CCTV camera's features and figure out a way to connect it somehow so that I can deploy my ML model somewhere that connects the CCTV.
    - Next steps include real-time implementation of the face mask detection system at my home with an integration of CCTV, mobile server/e-mail for notification purposes and automation ofcourse. I do not possess veteran skills in these fields as of now. But it's a challenge to myself to implement this real-time system as per my scheduled plan.
